# Python
Here I am learning Python


--------DATE:8.12.2025-------    ======About mistake done in commit messages (REASON & Correction Measures)=========
                                                                                

I am using commits as the heading of the of the file topic. 
( I Started this because when I started learning python , then I used to name file as 

Basic_of_python
  |
  |----Basic_of_pyhton-01 
  |----Basic_of_pyhton-02 
  |----Basic_of_pyhton-03
  |----....ETC..... 


So for knowing What content each file contain I use commits as the Title of file (on the github -after push file)

but 

Now onwards I will use the commit messages are as changes done in the file also,
file naming system is also Improved my me.
).
