Strings are primarilly written in 3 ways :
\n 
1.  Inside : single quotes '_____'        -----   need \ for using '' inside string 
2.  Inside : double quotes "_____"        -----   normal 
3.  Inside : triple quotes """"___"""""   -----   multilines strings 
\n
""")
# NOTE :There is no difference between the all these 3 but In the single quotes if we want single quotes in string inside single quoted string then must use \ as shown above 

somestring= 'That\'s string ' # here we use \ to use ' inside the string
