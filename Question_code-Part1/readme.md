This folder is created to do Question practice on python codes which are divided into 
the parts :: 

🔹 Part 1 – Direct Python Code (No functions, no classes)
This is where you write straightforward scripts — line by line.
Focus: Syntax, data types, and control flow.
Topics & Examples:
Basic I/O → print(), input()
Variables & Data types → int, float, string, list, tuple, dict, set
Operators → arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise
Conditional statements → if, elif, else
Loops → for, while, nested loops
Simple Programs:
Calculator
Fibonacci series
Prime number check
Sorting a list
Pattern printing (stars, numbers, etc.)
👉 At this level, the goal is: “Write small programs directly, without reusable code.”


🔹 Part 2 – Python with Functions (Modular Code)
Here you start organizing code into functions to avoid repetition and make code reusable.
Focus: Functions, scopes, built-in methods, error handling.
Topics & Examples:
Defining functions with def
Arguments → positional, keyword, default, variable-length (*args, **kwargs)
Return values
Recursion (factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, etc.)
Lambda functions
Built-in functions → map(), filter(), reduce(), zip(), enumerate()
Error handling → try-except-finally
Practical Programs:
Factorial using recursion
Calculator with functions
File handling with functions
Mini projects (e.g., Student grading system, Menu-driven apps)
👉 At this level, the goal is: “Think in reusable blocks.”


🔹 Part 3 – Python with Classes (OOP & Advanced Concepts)
This is the object-oriented stage where you learn professional coding practices.
Focus: Classes, objects, OOP principles, and advanced Python features.
Topics & Examples:
Classes & Objects → defining, creating, and using objects
Constructors (__init__) & Destructors
Instance, Class, and Static methods
Inheritance → single, multiple, multilevel
Polymorphism & Method Overriding
Encapsulation & Abstraction
Special methods (__str__, __len__, operator overloading)
File Handling with Classes
Modules & Packages → import, custom modules
Mini OOP Projects:
Bank account system (deposit, withdraw, balance)
Library management system
Student management system
ATM simulator
👉 At this level, the goal is: “Write structured, professional, and scalable programs.”
